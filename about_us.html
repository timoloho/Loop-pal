            <div class="created-text-box"><p class="created-text">Loop-pal has been created by four high school students as part of the Changemakers program in 2021/22. Two of them are from Estonia - Annakiis Viikmaa and Markus Kukk and the other two are from Finland - Emmi Gr√∂nross and Saara Hakala.</p></div>
            <div><h2 class="idea-header">Where did this idea come from?</h2></div>
            <div class="idea-text-box"><p class="idea-text">Our topic was "How to do more sustainable choices?" and after several brainstorming sessions, Annaliis and Markus came up with an idea that now results in this website. We got out insipration from the Facebook marketplace, but when we realized how difficult it is to use the Facebook marketplace and find exactly the things you want, we decided to create a simpeler version of it and created Loop-pal</p></div>

            <div class="boal-text-box"><p>Our goal is to reduce waste. Especially for things that aren't quite broken and are still usable. Most people throw away things they don't need or leave them in the conrner to collect dust, but we want to give people the opportunity to sell things like that and buy used things that they don't want to buy in a new store</p></div>
            <div class="meaning-box"><h2>What does Loop mean?</h2></div>
            <div class="meaning-text-box"><p>"Loop" shows how things move from one person to another, that is, things get used again.</p></div>
            <div class="meaning-box-1"><p>"Pal" shows this friendly group of people who sell and buy used things to save the environment and not immediately throw away all unnecessary things.</p></div>
